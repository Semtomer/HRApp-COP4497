This repository is for introduction of the 'Simple HR' app I made in the COP4497 KUIKA Web and Mobile Application Development course I took at Bahçeşehir University Software Engineering department. (4th grade 1st semester)

NOTE: The source codes provided by KUIKA are divided into WebUI and Backend. I did not test these source codes myself on a separate server. What you see in the video is the version I ran on the KUIKA platform.

PROJECT DETAILS

This project aims to develop a web and mobile application designed to facilitate the management of human resources processes within companies. The project covers recruitment, performance evaluation, and training processes on a single platform, supported by a user-friendly interface and robust data analytics capabilities. The goal is to ensure active participation of employees and managers in processes, enable data-driven decision-making, and improve overall HR efficiency.

The Simple HR application, developed as part of this project, is a user-friendly web application built using the low-code platform KUIKA. It is designed to streamline and manage core Human Resources processes, offering a central hub for key information and functionalities. Within the application, users can manage employee information, salaries, available jobs, courses, performance statistics, and gain an overview of income and expense statistics.

Specifically, Simple HR provides the following key features:

• Recruitment: Streamlined job posting and application process, allowing employees to easily view and apply for open positions.  
• Performance Evaluation: Tracks individual and overall performance statistics, enabling data-driven insights into employee productivity and contributions.  
• Centralized Information Hub: Manages employee information, salaries, and other HR-related data in a secure and accessible location.  
• Data Analytics: Provides an overview of income and expense statistics, empowering managers with financial insights for informed decision-making.

The Simple HR application is an efficient and user-friendly solution designed to streamline HR processes and optimize workflow, ultimately contributing to improved HR efficiency and organizational success.

Features:

• User Login: Users can log in with their credentials to use the application. Both employee and admin accounts are available, each with different access levels and functionalities.   
• Application Navigation: A clean and intuitive interface allows users to easily navigate through the various sections of the application, including available jobs, profile details, performance statistics, courses, and other HR-related options.   
• Applying for Jobs: Employees can view available job openings and apply for them directly through the application. Each job listing includes detailed information, including the department, title, salary, and description.   
• Profile Management: Users can access their personal profiles, edit their information, including profile pictures, and update important details such as address or contact information.   
• Performance Statistics: The application tracks individual and overall performance statistics. Story points are tracked to provide an overview of employee performance. Managers can manage and edit performance data by filtering by year and month.   
• Course Management: The application includes course features to facilitate employee development. Course titles, course videos, respective instructors, and course descriptions are displayed. Managers can manage and delete courses as needed.   
• Income and Expense Statistics: Managers can access annual income and expense data for the business, as well as the amount of net profit generated. The data is visualized using graphs, highlighting key trends and financial performance metrics, including net profit. Managers can easily manage, update, and add new statistics to this data.   
• Employee Management: Managers can view the employee list, see detailed information about each employee, and edit their job information, including job titles or departments.
